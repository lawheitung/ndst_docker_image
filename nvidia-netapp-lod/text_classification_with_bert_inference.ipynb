    "In the training notebook you leveraged Neural Modules (NeMo) to train a state of the art NLP model (BERT). You started with a model that had been pre-trained on a massive corpus of text and assessed the performance against a trivial dataset. You then used the SST-2 dataset to fine-tune the model to perform a specific use case. In that notebook this training took a few minutes over a small number of epochs, but with real-world applications and larger datasets this fine-tuning can take hours or days.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process you also leveraged NetApp storage to take Snapshots of the trained model checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, inference refers to applying a trained model to real-world data that was not part of the training in order to make a prediction based on that data. For inference, you instantiate the same neural models you used for training, but using the checkpoints that captured the enhanced model that captures the training results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will re-instantiate the enhanced model using the same model architecture and the model weights and checkpoints that were learned during training. You will then utilize the [NetApp AI Control Plane](https://blog.netapp.com/ai-control-plane) to perform data management tasks to assess and compare the results of the untrained and enhanced model versions. Lastly you will investigate how to use this functionality to implement traceability and rollbacks."
